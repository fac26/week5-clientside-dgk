## Rules of the game

The game follows (mostly!) standard Blackjack rules. 

‚ô•Ô∏è  ‚ô†Ô∏è ‚ô¶Ô∏è ‚ô£Ô∏è 

Players attempt to reach a score of 21 ‚Äî without exceeding it (busting) ‚Äî before the dealer hits 17. 

‚ô•Ô∏è  ‚ô†Ô∏è ‚ô¶Ô∏è ‚ô£Ô∏è 

- You (the player) are dealt two cards (face up)
- The dealer is dealt two cards, but one of the cards is kept face down
- Considering your starting total, and the visible total of the dealer, you can either
    - **hit**: whereby you are dealt an additional card; or
    - **stick**: where your value is locked and the game moves onto the dealer's cards
- You can hit as many times as you like, but you will '**bust**' and lose if your total surpasses 21
- Once you're happy with your total, click stick to move onto the dealer
- The dealer must be hit (take on an additional card) if their starting value is below 17
- Whoever has the highest total equal to or less than 21 wins! 

The dealer process is automated - the game result will be rendered as soon as you click stick - good luck! üÉè

## Code Review Considerations

- The dealer automation occurs quite quickly - the end result will show the dealer's score, but will hide all the cards. 
- We have not yet implemented functionality to keep track of your score - sorry! 
- We still have some working notes hanging in the ```main``` branch.
- The background will depend on your local device settings (dark vs light).
